## Sign the Waiver

All visitors, whether taking a class or maintain a regular membership, must complete our waiver form. You can fill out a waiver at our lobby kiosk or save time and fill out the waiver beforehand at the link below. You must be at least 18 years old to complete the form, otherwise a parent or legal guardian must sign.

## Visting Us

We are open every Tuesday evening starting at 7pm for visitors to come to the lab, tour the facilities, and meet the leadership team.  If that timing does not work with your schedule then [join our Discord Server](https://discord.thelab.ms/) and ask in the General channel about setting up another time.

### Until then...
